Wilmar,Governance,Board Oversight,"Climate-related risks and opportunities are overseen at Board level through the Board of Directors, with dedicated support from the Board Sustainability Committee (BSC) rather than the Audit Committee. The Chairman and CEO has overall accountability for climate-related policies, climate risk and opportunity management, and the setting and implementation of climate targets.The BSC reviews and approves ESG/sustainability strategies, evaluates climate-related risks and opportunities, and monitors the implementation of climate-related risk management policies, systems and practices. It also reviews progress against climate targets and receives quarterly updates from management on emerging ESG developments, physical and transition climate risks/opportunities, GHG target performance, and implementation of the climate transition plan, which informs Board-level strategy and financial planning discussions.",Ga1,Processes to inform board/committee about climate-related issues,Full,P169,"""The BSC and Board receive quarterly updates from Wilmar's SMT…"""

Functional and operational teams are responsible for identifying, assessing and monitoring climate-related risks within their respective areas, while the Sustainability Department/ISA evaluates reported risks, provides advisory guidance on sustainability trends and stakeholder expectations, and coordinates escalation where needed. Material risks, including those with significant potential financial implications, are escalated for further assessment, and mitigation/adaptation actions are implemented and monitored by relevant departments, with cross-functional working teams formed where necessary to coordinate response and track effectiveness.",Ga8,Assigned to management/committees,Full,"P17,19","""SMT-Oversees the day-to-day management of sustainability related matters"",""Wilmar’s Chief Sustainability Officer...leads the SMT…The Sustainability Department…"""

,Strategy,Climate-Related Risks and Opportunities,"Wilmar has identified climate-related risks and opportunities across the short, medium and long term through a refreshed materiality assessment supported by quantitative climate scenario analysis. The assessment covers both transition risks (including regulations, technology, legal, market and reputation risks) and physical risks (acute and chronic), and considers financially significant risks and opportunities across key assets, geographies and commodities. Wilmar also identifies climate-related opportunities linked to product innovation, market access (e.g., sustainability-certified products) and resilience-building measures such as climate-adaptive crop development.",Sa1,Description of time horizons,Partial,P170,"""Wilmar uses internationally recognised climate scenarios to review R&Os over short-, medium- and long-term horizons."""

,,"Impact on Business, Strategy, and Financial Planning","Wilmar describes climate-related risks and opportunities as affecting its operations, supply chain, product strategy and business resilience, and uses quantitative assessment findings to refresh its climate-related priorities. The results are used to inform management and leadership discussions on strategy and resilience, including mitigation and adaptation actions, product development and operational improvements.

,,Resilience of Strategy:,"Wilmar assesses the resilience of its strategy using multiple climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C or lower transition scenario and a higher-warming physical risk scenario. It uses both transition and physical risk pathways (e.g., NGFS- and IPCC-aligned scenarios) to evaluate potential impacts across selected material assets, geographies and business segments, and to support strategy and resilience planning. The report demonstrates a structured scenario-selection approach and strategic use of scenario outputs, although disclosure of detailed assumptions and quantified impacts on financial performance/position remains limited.",Sc1,Description of resilience,Partial,P170,"""Wilmar adopts a long-term holistic approach to integrating sustainability into our business strategy as we seek not only to protect the resilience...Investing in the R&D of palm seedlings that are more resilient to extreme weather patterns"""
